# The range() function does the following

* Returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0, and increments by 1 (by default)
* It ends at one less than the specified number.
  * For eg in this range - range(10) the loop will end on 9.

# Writing a program which does the following:

* Output to the console a sequence of numbers ending at 24 using "for" loop and the "range()" syntax
* Also print "LOOP ENDED" when the loop is over
